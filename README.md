## Initial setup guid
1. Clone this repository
2. go to the directory in which you cloned the repository and run `main.py`

When you first run the main.py file, you will notice a new `data.sqlite` file in your folder.
This file contains all the data concerning your school, so **DON'T delete it unless you're willing to reset all the data.**
